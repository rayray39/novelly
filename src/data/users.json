It also features a quote book with Po's favorite sayings! Dumplings not included. Po is the Dragon Warrior, chosen by Master Oogway to wield the Staff of Wisdom. But when Master Shifu makes a shocking announcement—that Po must train his successor and assume the mantle of Spiritual Leader—Po isn’t sure he’s ready. He’s great at kicking butt, but sharing wisdom with the Valley of Peace? Not so much. But when an evil empress named The Chameleon seeks to open the Spirit Realm and steal the knowledge of kung fu masters, Po must find a way to stop her. Otherwise there may not be a world for the next Dragon Warrior to protect! This epic retelling of Kung Fu Panda 4 also contains 8 full-color pages of Po's favorite quotes, like \"But first, dumplings.\" DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda © 2024 DreamWorks Animation LLC.

        "description": "Batman Unauthorized explores Batman's motivations and actions, as well as those of his foes. Batman is a creature of the night, more about vengeance than justice, more plagued by doubts than full of self-assurance, and more darkness than light. He has no superpowers, just skill, drive and a really well-made suit. One of the most recognized superheroes ever created, Batman has survived through campy TV shows and films, through actors such as Adam West, Michael Keaton and Christian Bale. Batman Unauthorized: Vigilantes, Jokers, and Heroes in Gotham City covers expansive territory ranging from the silly to the solemn. Why is the Joker so good at pushing Batman's buttons? What does Batman's technology say about the times? Why are Batman's villains crazier than average? And why is Batman the perfect, iconic American hero?"
